          <p>This project was started December 26th, 2017.</p>
          <p>There were the following versions:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>サカキバラUI (3DS)</li>
            <li>サカキバラUI: Nintendo Switch Edition</li>

                <li style="color: var(--warn-color);">
                  There's not much information available about this version.
                  The last surviving copy is dated 16/10/2021 and 17/6/2022
                  for assets and the main program respectively. It's speculated
                  the actual development time was rather short, estimated at
                  just 1 month.</li>

                </center>
                <span style="line-height: 16pt;">
                  I decided to take an existing project from <a href="https://old.smilebasicsource.com" class="classic">SmileBASIC Source</a>.
                  This project is
                  <a href="https://smilebasicsource.com/user/andritolion" class="classic">andritolion</a>'s
                  <a href="https://smilebasicsource.com/page?pid=516" class="classic">3DS OS Home Edition</a> and called it <i>Windows 3DS Pro</i>.<br><br>
                  Therefore, the first version, <b>v0.1</b> was created. However, I haven't made it public at this point.
                  Then, I improved the code and added the command prompt.<br>
                  <b>v0.2</b> and the SmileBASIC Source page were publically released on December 27th 2017.<br>
                  3-4 months later, andritolion, the creator of <i>3DS OS</i>, threatened me by filing a DMCA takedown notice. See the below screenshot.<br><br>
                </span>
                <center>
                  <img src="/assets/images/skkbaui/sbs-andrew-dmca.png" width="256px" class="bord4 imgshdw" title="Right-click and select 'Open in new tab'" alt="3DS OS by andritolion">
                  <p><sup><a href="https://smilebasicsource.com/page?pid=1030&page=2" class="classic" target="_blank"><u>andritolion threatening to file the takedown</u></a></sup></p>
                </center>
                <span style="line-height: 16pt;">
                  Obviously, this was an illegit takedown. SmileBASIC projects cannot be licensed, so anyone can share and modify it,
                  including reuploads, like I did: I forked his project to start making mine.
                  <br><br>
                  Then, in 2019, with the version <b>0.3.2</b> I was thinking about the name again, figured it could be dangerous, as it does kinda imply that it's an
                  official thing, even though it obviously wasn't. At that point, it was named <b>Windows6Mix</b>.<br><br>
                  I didn't really get that far with the crummy code, based on 3DS OS and I wanted to make reset the entire
                  project and start with a different base that easily allows multi-tasking.<br>
                  That's where
                  <a href="https://smilebasicsource.com/page?pid=1213" class="classic" target="_blank">ミドリOS by Autz64</a>
                  comes into play.<br><br>
                  When Autz64 released Midori OS in beta, I was impressed and asked him for
                  permission to use the beta as a base.
                  <span style="color: var(--sidenote-color);">Although I could've just
                  taken it, I took extra steps, just to make sure Autz64 wasn't
                  getting pissed at me, like andritolion was, but he accepted
                  rather quickly.</span><br><br>
                  The new base was part of the overall rewrite of the project, which
                  made it public in version <b>0.3.3</b>. I don't know, whether it was
                  coincidence or me unconciously wanting to copy the style but I then
                  renamed the project to <b><i>サカキバラUI.</i></b><br><br>
                  It stayed that way and I added some features to Midori OS under
                  サカキバラUI. First, be it new cursors, new features in the packages
                  or even customizable desktop themes.<br><br>
                  This version <span style="color: var(--sidenote-color);">(released
                  as beta revisions for some reason)</span> introduced other major
                  things, such as language packs, customize th installation with toggles
                  in the setup utility, or even the <i>サカキバラUI Menu</i>.<br>
                  The サカキバラUI Menu was a launcher, designed after the Nintendo DSi
                  Menu, where you can launch programs that aren't supported on the
                  desktop.<br><br>
                  After version <b>0.3.6</b>, which enhanced the keyboard, I was so
                  close to get my hands on a Nintendo Switch and felt I was kinda done for
                  on the 3DS and added a discontinuation note in <b>0.3.7r0</b>, which was a
                  timed window that announced I was discontinuing the 3DS version and the
                  Switch version should have been released on September 2020.<br><br>
                  On the 3DS front, nothing really happened, ever since. I just left it
                  counting the days until it's officially dead. Kinda dark, isn't it?

          <p>Being short and sweet, it was a disaster. I rushed the first version within 4 days that I had got my Nintendo Switch.</p>
          <p>
            <a href="https://twitter.com/CyberYoshi64/status/1321553664075595777?s=20" class="classic" target="_blank">It didn't last very long, at all.</a>
            Yes, it got killed within 4 months, due to the heavy mental pressure I had at the time from school.
          </p>
          <p>I was so in distress, I wiped my save file on the Switch (and disabled
          cloud backup) so I don't have a backup of it anymore.</p>
          <p>However, you can still get back to my Twitter profile and scroll all
          the way back to the timeframe and see the little progress I had before
          ultimately terminating it.</p>

          <p>CYMOS had its humble beginnings on SmileBASIC 4. Having a mock BIOS mostly finished and a bootloader that would eventually install packages too...</p>
    	    <p>I got fed up with SmileBASIC 4 over the span of 2021 and moved over to make CYMOS for SmileBASIC 3 with the New Nintendo 3DS in mind, with enhancements if run on a Wii U. <span style="color:var(--sidenote-color);">(If you're lucky enough to even have Petitcom BIG)</span></p>

            <br><sup>A very "proof-of-concept" version of CYMOS running in SmileBASIC 4. Glitchy graphics here and there but given a bit more features and a bit of polish, would have made it a solid first alpha release.</sup>
          </p>
          <p>
            Note that the date shown in the video is not accurate. The files of this project are from 2021/1/11 to 2021/11/21. This proof-of-concept version on SmileBASIC 4 had a life time of 10 months, however, during this time I was quite inactive. The active development time is estimated to be only 2 months.
          </p>
          <p>CYMOS on SmileBASIC 3 had a rocky start but is slowly building up.</p>
          <p>During development of Beta 6, I started development on <a href="/prj/sb/cyx" class="classic">the CYX plugin</a> and wanted to incorporate it into CYMOS as a kind of helper; a kind of showcase how CYX can change how SmileBASIC programs can run and what they can do. So I implemented various file-management-based features into CYX that allow reading from and writing to the SD Card as well as access to general system information.</p>
