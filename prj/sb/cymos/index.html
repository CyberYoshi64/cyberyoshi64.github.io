                    <p>There were the following versions:</p>

              <p>As soon as I received a Nintendo eShop card to buy SmileBASIC 3, I immediately wanted to make a mock Windows environment.</p>

                <p><sup><a href="https://old.smilebasicsource.com/page?pid=516" target="_blank"><u>3DS OS by andritolion</u></a></sup></p>
              </center>
              <span style="line-height: 16pt;">
                I decided to take an existing project from <a href="https://old.smilebasicsource.com">SmileBASIC Source</a>.
                This project is
                <a href="https://old.smilebasicsource.com/user/andritolion">andritolion</a>'s
                <a href="https://old.smilebasicsource.com/page?pid=516">3DS OS Home Edition</a> and called it <i>Windows 3DS Pro</i>.<br><br>
                Therefore, the first version, <b>v0.1</b> was created. However, I haven't made it public at this point.
                Then, I improved the code and added the command prompt.<br>
                <b>v0.2</b> and the SmileBASIC Source page were publically released on December 27th 2017.<br>
                3-4 months later, andritolion, the creator of <i>3DS OS</i>, threatened me by filing a DMCA takedown notice. See the below screenshot.<br><br>
              </span>
              <center>
                <img src="/assets/images/skkbaui/sbs-andrew-dmca.png" width="256px" class="bord4 imgshdw" title="Right-click and select 'Open in new tab'" alt="3DS OS by andritolion">
                <p><sup><a href="https://old.smilebasicsource.com/page?pid=1030&page=2" target="_blank"><u>andritolion threatening to file the takedown</u></a></sup></p>
              </center>
              <span style="line-height: 16pt;">
                Obviously, this was an illegit takedown. SmileBASIC projects cannot be licensed, so anyone can share and modify it,
                including reuploads, like I did: I forked his project to start making mine.
                <br><br>
                Then, in 2019, with the version <b>0.3.2</b> I was thinking about the name again, figured it could be dangerous, as it does kinda imply that it's an
                official thing, even though it obviously wasn't. At that point, it was named <b>Windows6Mix</b>.<br><br>
                I didn't really get that far with the crummy code, based on 3DS OS and I wanted to make reset the entire
                project and start with a different base that easily allows multi-tasking.<br>
                That's where
                <a href="https://old.smilebasicsource.com/page?pid=1213" target="_blank">ミドリOS by Autz64 (Old SBS</a>
                / <a href="https://smilebasicsource.com/?p=page-2359" target="_blank">SBS)</a>, comes into play.<br><br>
                When Autz64 released Midori OS in beta, I was impressed and asked him for
                permission to use the beta as a base.
                <span style="color: var(--sidenote-color);">Although I could've just
                taken it, I took extra steps, just to make sure Autz64 wasn't
                getting pissed at me, like andritolion was, but he accepted
                rather quickly.</span><br><br>
                The new base was part of the overall rewrite of the project, which
                made it public in version <b>0.3.3</b>. I don't know, whether it was
                coincidence or me unconciously wanting to copy the style but I then
                renamed the project to <b><i>サカキバラUI.</i></b><br><br>
                It stayed that way and I added some features to Midori OS under
                サカキバラUI. First, be it new cursors, new features in the packages
                or even customizable desktop themes.<br><br>
                This version <span style="color: var(--sidenote-color);">(released
                as beta revisions for some reason)</span> introduced other major
                things, such as language packs, customize th installation with toggles
                in the setup utility, or even the <i>サカキバラUI Menu</i>.<br>
                The サカキバラUI Menu was a launcher, designed after the Nintendo DSi
                Menu, where you can launch programs that aren't supported on the
                desktop.<br><br>
                After version <b>0.3.6</b>, which enhanced the keyboard, I was so
                close to get my hands on a Nintendo Switch and felt I was kinda done for
                on the 3DS and added a discontinuation note in <b>0.3.7r0</b>, which was a
                timed window that announced I was discontinuing the 3DS version and the
                Switch version should have been released on September 2020.<br><br>
                On the 3DS front, nothing really happened, ever since. I just left it
                counting the days until it's officially dead. Kinda dark, isn't it?
              </span>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="dropdown">
            <button class="wrap1" style="transform:none;">
              <table width="100%"><tr align="left"><td>
                About サカキバラUI: Switch version (July 2020 - October 2020)

            <div class="divbtnsw" id="dropdwn0-col" style="height: 0px; opacity: 0; margin-top: 0px; padding: 0px;">
              <span>
                Being short and sweet, it was a disaster.<br><br>
                I rushed the first version within 4 days that I had got
                my Nintendo Switch. <br><br>
                <a href="https://twitter.com/CyberYoshi64/status/1321553664075595777?s=20" target="_blank">It didn't last very long, at all.</a>
                Yes, it got killed within 4 months, due to the heavy mental pressure
                I had at the time from school.<br><br>
                I was so in distress, I wiped my save file on the Switch (and disabled
                cloud backup) so I don't have a backup of it anymore.<br>
                However, you can still get back to my Twitter profile and scroll all
                the way back to the timeframe and see the little progress I had before
                ultimately terminating it.
