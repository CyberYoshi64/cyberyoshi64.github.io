              <h3>About real me</h3>
              <span style="display: block; padding-bottom: 1em;">
                Being a student at a regular school was hands-down, the worst
                part of my life. Coupled with me being autistic, was literally
                asking for mental hell. <br><br>
                And it was, especially because german schools are just cruel: <br>
                School buildings awaiting maintenance, overhead projectors,
                incompetent teachers and other students, that very well could've
                been demons after all. Just to name an "incident": <br><br>

                In 4th grade, I was harassed by someone who learned
                karate in his free-time. He offensively kicked and
                broke my right arm as a result. The teachers assumed
                I was pretending to cry in agony, so I was forced to
                continue going to the lessons that day. I couldn't write
                anything down, as I'm right-handed. I was sent out and,
                thankfully, my parents, as soon as they noticed my arm,
                I was then sent to the hospital and it was confirmed that
                my arm's bones were cleanly broken in half.<br><br>

                Wow… then Germany expects students like me, to not get
                mentally destroyed? That's awesome, not gonna lie. /s<br>
                Since 1st grade, the other kids immediately excluded me,
                being the odd one out and were just rude when asking/telling them
                simple things. It got worse and worse, eventually, the teachers noticed
                I was quite unusual, so they also tended to exclude me as well, as of me
                getting worse grades and the principal admitting she wanted me gone from
                school, just because I wasn't the small soldier doing anything they wanted
                us to do. I often rebelled, claiming things are ridiculous. <br>
                Shocking to see, when only one teacher from the entire school cracked the
                code of me and figured that I have potential, that I simply cannot express
                whatsoever. <br><br>
                Then, in 5th grade, I went to middle school and it was, and still is, the
                worst year I ever had. Every teacher was negative against me and almost
                everyone on the school targetted me and kept insulting me. Now, when I say
                that, sounds kinda normal nowadays, but keep in mind that I am autistic;
                any kind of attack, be it minor, such as a dumb joke, or major, like
                insults or threats, I treat with exponential impact on me. That happens
                automatically, I wish that isn't the case but sadly, it is and I can't
                really change that. <br>
                Unfortunately, after 4th grade has ended, I became really spoiled I felt like.
                I was more rebellious and refuses to do more things. <br><br>
                Then, 6th grade hit, where I was moved to high school as the teachers were
                forced to do that and it was a way to keep me away, also. <br>
                My spoiledness at first, didn't help catching up with the present and I became
                a laughing stock as I was attempting to be scary in a very cringy way that
                didn't help at all. Back then, I didn't catch that and I kept being cringy, until
                my new classmates decided to troll me really good, which, was quite radical and
                I considered it a threat. They took away my stuff, kept laughing at me and it
                eventually triggered me, resulting in me smacking my head against the wall, and
                also me running out of the classroom and locked myself down in the toilet. <br>
                Eventually, the school was forced to call my parents and were close to call the police
                to find me. The principal there, figured I was too unstable and light-headed,
                that I was sent to outpatients clinic in 7th/8th grade. <br><br>
                While I was very pessimistic about that, it really helped be getting stable again,
                to summarize all of it. Although the bad reputation I had for my classmates since 6th
                grade, didn't really help. They still mocked me occasionally and some of them still liked
                to harass me, even though I was a lot more calm than before. That did calm down over
                time, thankfully. <br><br>
                What made my mental stability back down, was the overall pressure applied by the school
                for grades 9 and 10. <br><br>
                The topics were even less relatable to me, the IT lessons were just as useless
                to me, as they always were... oh wait. I didn't tell you about that? I'll talk about that later. <br><br>
                Eventually, the COVID-19 pandemic went in full swing in 10th grade. Ironically, I'm thankful
                that it happened at that time, as I was finally being able to learn everything from at home. <br>
                Although, Germany wasn't really prepared for the pandemic, in case of education, very well at all. <br>
                The systems used were quite unreliable for me, I had lots of connection issues in online classes and
                I even had my school account bricked for whatever reason. <br><br>
                When I had to make my scientific homework for IT and generally, when we had to send back our homework
                for marking them, I was really in distress and couldn't stand it. That's how I got bad marks over and over
                again. <br><br>
                To summarize the rest, as I got worse marks, the more pressure I was put under. I was losing the will to even bother with continuing.
                <i>Even thinking about suicide</i> but eventually, the school year ended and I still got my graduation. <br><br>
                Sadly, the over all time caused me to build up school fever. I simply cannot look at a school-like building without
                my brain metaphorically shut off. Hence why I had an apprenticeship September 2020, only to cancel that 3 days later. <br><br>
                I really cannot express, how much school made my life worse than it actually helped. If I look back, I reckon that
                I learned next to nothing in most subjects, that I can use outside of school. And since internships and other
                apprenticeships don't accept new people (due to the pandemic) I sit at home, trying my best to at least get some joy out of
                living, but not even that is easy, especially when my father doesn't really know how to deal with me, he keeps forgetting my quirks. <br>
                Due to how my father makes crude jokes and how serious he is, leads to countless
                misunderstandings that also make me upset. <br><br>
                Then the issue with my therapist I'm at. He doesn't help me, as he can't. He also disregards my autism and claims I just have a
                psychosis, so I get medicine that doesn't help whatsoever. They think it works but the issue is that over time, I'm
                cleaning up my brain myself, which makes me feel better overall, he didn't do anything in that regard. <br>
                The only reason why I'm there, is because he is the only way I can still get an apprenticeship without me immediately
                cancelling it. I honestly have the feeling, it won't go anywhere. My parents want me and I have to keep lying to him,
                making up stories and therefore, follow steps that don't have any effect on me. <br><br>
                It's just sickening. No question that I honestly just want to stay alone and just help myself.
